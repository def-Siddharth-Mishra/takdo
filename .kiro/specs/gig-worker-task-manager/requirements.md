# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gig Worker Task Manager is a simple mobile application designed for gig workers to efficiently manage their tasks. The app provides a clean, modern interface for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks with Firebase-based authentication and cloud storage. The application follows Clean Architecture principles with BLoC/Riverpod state management, uses freezed for immutable data classes, and json_serializable for JSON serialization to ensure scalability, testability, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gig worker, I want to authenticate securely using my email and password, so that I can access my personal task data across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a splash screen with the app branding
2. WHEN a user needs to authenticate THEN the system SHALL provide email/password login and registration forms matching the Reference1.png design
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display clear, user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main task dashboard
5. WHEN a user chooses to register THEN the system SHALL create a new Firebase Authentication account
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages (invalid email, wrong password, network error, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a gig worker, I want to create and manage tasks with detailed information, so that I can organize my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to create a task THEN the system SHALL provide a form with fields for title, description, due date, priority, and status
2. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL store it in Firebase Firestore with a unique identifier
3. WHEN a user views their tasks THEN the system SHALL display all task information in a card-based layout
4. WHEN a user wants to edit a task THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all task fields
5. WHEN a user wants to delete a task THEN the system SHALL remove it from Firestore after confirmation
6. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the task status and visual representation
7. IF a task priority is set THEN the system SHALL accept values of low, medium, or high
8. IF a task status is set THEN the system SHALL accept values of complete or incomplete

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gig worker, I want to filter and sort my tasks, so that I can focus on the most important and urgent work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to filter tasks THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter by priority (low, medium, high)
2. WHEN a user wants to filter tasks THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter by status (completed, incomplete)
3. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL display only tasks matching the selected criteria
4. WHEN a user wants to sort tasks THEN the system SHALL provide sorting by due date from earliest to latest
5. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine them using AND logic
6. WHEN no filters are applied THEN the system SHALL display all user tasks
7. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL return to showing all tasks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gig worker, I want a clean and intuitive user interface, so that I can efficiently navigate and use the app without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a UI matching the Reference2.png design as closely as possible
2. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL use a card-based layout with clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN showing task priorities THEN the system SHALL use color-coded badges (different colors for low/medium/high)
4. WHEN displaying the main interface THEN the system SHALL include bottom navigation, floating action button, and search functionality
5. WHEN tasks are grouped THEN the system SHALL organize them by time periods (Today, Tomorrow, This week)
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive for both iOS and Android platforms
7. WHEN using Material Design THEN the system SHALL follow Material Design 3 guidelines
8. WHEN displaying task status THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators (checkboxes, completion states)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a gig worker, I want my data to be synchronized across devices, so that I can access my tasks from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates, updates, or deletes a task THEN the system SHALL immediately sync changes to Firebase Firestore
2. WHEN a user logs in from a different device THEN the system SHALL load their complete task list from Firestore
3. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL cache tasks locally for viewing
4. WHEN the device reconnects THEN the system SHALL sync any offline changes to Firestore
5. WHEN multiple devices are used simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle real-time updates appropriately
6. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use server-side data as the source of truth

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this app, I want the codebase to follow Clean Architecture principles with modern Dart features, so that the app is scalable, testable, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow Clean Architecture with data/domain/presentation layers
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use BLoC or Riverpod pattern for all business logic
3. WHEN creating data models THEN the system SHALL use freezed package for immutable data classes
4. WHEN handling JSON serialization THEN the system SHALL use json_serializable for automatic serialization/deserialization
5. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL be testable with proper dependency injection
6. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL use a clear folder structure (data/domain/presentation)
7. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
8. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use proper abstraction and interfaces
